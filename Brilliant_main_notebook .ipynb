        "The following python program is developed from a class called FilePro. It is able to analyze folder_1 as an object using three different methods. These methods involve several imported python libraries, namely os, glob, re, hashlib, datetime, json, numpy, pandas, and treelib. The program uses three methods outside of the object constructor: get_info, generate_report, and tree_diagram. Each method produces a deliverable with information about folder_1 in different ways. The following is the code that developed the program using each of the aforementioned libraries, followed by demonstrations of the functionality of each non-constructor method."

        "The first method in FilePro is get_info. This method is used to identify specific characteristics of each file in folder_1. These characteristics are the extensions, sizes, MD5 checksum values, names, paths, and dates of modification for each file. In order to read each file more easily, the method separates folder_1 into four levels of organization using glob. Within each level, the characteristics are determined with various libraries. File extensions and names are determined using the regex findall function. File sizes are determined using the os path and getsize functions. MD5 checksum values are determined by reading each file in binary and using the hashlib md5 and hexdigest functions. Filepaths are determined by finding the path of the current working directory with the os get cwd function and concatenating them with the paths of each file. Dates of modification are determined by using the os path and getmtime functions, converting from timestamps to datetime using the datetime date and fromtimestamp functions, and converting from datetime to a date string using the datetime strftime function. It stores the file characteristics in dictionaries, which in turn are merged into a list. This list of dictionaries is then stored in a JSON file called file_info. The get_info method is also tied into the constructor method through a timing mechanism. If file_info has not been updated in two days or longer, then get_info overwrites the file with an updated version. Below, the functionality of get_info is displayed by opening file_info and reading each dictionary within it. The dictionaries within file_info that contain all the previously listed information are displayed below."

        "The second method in FilePro is generate_report. It uses the previous method's file_info JSON file to create a statistical report. This statistical report is  focused on comparisons related to the file and folder sizes within folder_1. The report contains mean and median file sizes for all files within folder_1, and also contains these statistics for each particular file extension. The means and medians are determined using numpy's mean and median functions. The organization of each unique file extension that allows for their mean and median sizes to be determined is performed by a sourced method called unique. This method converts lists to sets (which remove repeated elements) and converts the sets of unique elements back to lists. Thus, each file extension becomes a single dictionary key, and all values for each file extension become a list of dictionary values for their specified keys. Additionally, the largest folders by both number of files and combined file size are determined and displayed in the report. These are determined by performing similar methods to the organization of each file extension and their size. Each folder is organized into dictionaries with their unique names (derived from the unique method) as keys and either the file names or file sizes as the list of values. The number of file statistics is obtained by determining the length of each list of filenames in unique folders, and the combined file size is determined by summing the list of file sizes in unique folders. The maximum values for each are determined by performing the max function on each unique folder and determining the key associated with each max value. Each statistic is saved in a dictionary with their key identifying the type of statistic and their value indicating their numerical value. The report is created by saving each statistic into a dictionary, combining the dictionaries into a list, converting the list of dictionaries into a pandas data frame, and saving the data frame to a csv file called report. The generated report is displayed below.\n"
